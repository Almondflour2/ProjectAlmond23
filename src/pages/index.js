            <Content topic="Mission +">
                <p>Learning developing has involved lots of trial-and-error, medium scale project building. This has gotten me tangible results that I can deploy and show people on the fly. However, now that I can breathe under the infinite loop water, I want to shift my focus into making cleaner code.</p>
                <p>The outcome of this project will be a modular portfolio website. Modular, meaning I can integrate new features with ease. This will make discrepancies between new features and my base website simple to solve.</p>
                <p>Thinking towards the future, when working with others I want my code to be easy to read and to debug. The thought process is, that if I can write and understand what my own code is, I can read othersâ€™ code as well. In the name of learning and retaining, keeping my code well commented and using modules with exports and imports will keep me on track to understand things fully.</p> 
                <p>The internet is a scary, overstimulating, and intimidating place, so this practice of clean web-dev helps me extract the wonderful parts of it.</p>
